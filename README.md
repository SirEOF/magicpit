# magicpit

creates a tar file full of random file. each random file is created following a signature found on a magic file, 
magic(5) files is a config file for the unix command file(1)
format documentation: http://linux.die.net/man/5/magic

the idea is that someone scanning the file will find valid signatures for dummy files.
